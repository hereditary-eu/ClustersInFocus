- what logic in backend and what logic in frontend?
    - radical: all logic in backend -> higher latency, more reusability, cleaner practicces
    - fastapi vs flask restx?
    - cors
    - export api specs to ts types for frontend typechecking
    - add requirements.txt from the start
    - add config.py
    - should I do the computationally expensive stuff async?

- frontend:
    - styling:
        - completely revamp
    - table:
        -lazy loading?
    - can I safely rename the folder from data-analysis-dashboard to frontend?

- add install instructions in the readme
- write 2 dockerfiles, frontend + backend
    - look up if I can add a docker compose file without changing how the docker containers are created manually
    - check if docker on windows is still cheeks
    - which package-lock and package.json can be deleted?
